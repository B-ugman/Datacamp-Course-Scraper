Make sure you have libraries tqdm, pandas, and bs4 installed before running. You'll also need wget installed on your OS to run this program

Running this program will take a few minutes, as it'll grab the mainpage of Datacamp and determine how many pages there are to scrape with wget. When it's done, it'll produce a csv file that contains:
1. Title (Title of course)
2. Description (Description of course)
3. Length (Estimated time investment required for course)
4. Category (What topics the course covers)
5. Technology (What languages/tech is covered)
6. Teacher (Name of class instructor

Have fun scraping!
